    <div></br>For people who want to connect and share memories with friends, Twira is a social network that puts the user experience above all. </br>
         Unlike many social networks that only promote content that benefits their ideals and shut down the oposition, our solution will not limit one's freedom of speech and will ensure that everyone has an equal voice.</br>
         This project was developed in the course of LBAW and with it, our intent was to create a social network that allows the users to connect with each other, establishing friendship relations and groups and sharing content with one another.</br>
